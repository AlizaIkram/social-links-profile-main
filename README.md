### What I learned

While creating this social links profile using HTML and CSS, I gained a deeper understanding of structuring web content and applying responsive design principles. I practiced using semantic HTML tags to organize the layout effectively and explored CSS properties to style the elements, such as creating hover effects for the links and aligning items aesthetically. This project helped me improve my skills in creating visually appealing and functional web components, enhancing both usability and user experience.
